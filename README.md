Official code release for the CVPR 2024 paper: **OmniGlue: Generalizable Feature
Matching with Foundation Model Guidance**.

![og_diagram.png](res/og_diagram.png "og_diagram.png")

**Abstract:** The image matching field has been witnessing a continuous
emergence of novel learnable feature matching techniques, with ever-improving
performance on conventional benchmarks. However, our investigation shows that
despite these gains, their potential for real-world applications is restricted
by their limited generalization capabilities to novel image domains. In this
paper, we introduce OmniGlue, the first learnable image matcher that is designed
with generalization as a core principle. OmniGlue leverages broad knowledge from
a vision foundation model to guide the feature matching process, boosting
generalization to domains not seen at training time. Additionally, we propose a
novel keypoint position-guided attention mechanism which disentangles spatial
and appearance information, leading to enhanced matching descriptors. We perform
comprehensive experiments on a suite of 6 datasets with varied image domains,
including scene-level, object-centric and aerial images. OmniGlueâ€™s novel
components lead to relative gains on unseen domains of 18.8% with respect to a
directly comparable reference model, while also outperforming the recent
LightGlue method by 10.1% relatively.


## Installation

First, use pip to install `omniglue`:

```sh
conda create -n omniglue pip
conda activate omniglue

git clone https://github.com/google-research/omniglue.git
cd omniglue
pip install -e .
```

Then, download the following models to `./models/`

```sh
# Download to ./models/ dir.
mkdir models
cd models

# SuperPoint.
git clone https://github.com/rpautrat/SuperPoint.git
mv SuperPoint/weights/superpoint_v6_from_tf.pth . 
mv SuperPoint/pretrained_models/sp_v6.tgz . && rm -rf SuperPoint
tar zxvf sp_v6.tgz && rm sp_v6.tgz

# DINOv2 - vit-b14.
wget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/dinov2/dinov2_vitb14/dinov2_vitb14_pretrain.pth

# OmniGlue.
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/omniglue/og_export.zip
unzip og_export.zip && rm og_export.zip
```

## Usage
The code snippet below outlines how you can perform OmniGlue inference in your
own python codebase.

```py

import omniglue

image0 = ... # load images from file into np.array
image1 = ...

og = omniglue.OmniGlue(
  og_export='./models/og_export',
  sp_export='./models/sp_v6',
  dino_export='./models/dinov2_vitb14_pretrain.pth',
)

match_kp0s, match_kp1s, match_confidences = og.FindMatches(image0, image1)
# Output:
#   match_kp0: (N, 2) array of (x,y) coordinates in image0.
#   match_kp1: (N, 2) array of (x,y) coordinates in image1.
#   match_confidences: N-dim array of each of the N match confidence scores.
```

## Demo

`demo.py` contains example usage of the `omniglue` module. To try with your own
images, replace `./res/demo1.jpg` and `./res/demo2.jpg` with your own
filepaths.

```sh
conda activate omniglue
python demo.py ./res/demo1.jpg ./res/demo2.jpg
# <see output in './demo_output.png'>
```

Expected output:
![demo_output.png](res/demo_output.png "demo_output.png")


## Repo TODOs

- ~~Provide `demo.py` example usage script.~~
- ~~Add to image matching webui~~ (credit: [@Vincentqyw](https://github.com/Vincentqyw))
- Support matching for pre-extracted features.
- Release eval pipelines for in-domain (MegaDepth).
- Release eval pipelines for all out-of-domain datasets.
